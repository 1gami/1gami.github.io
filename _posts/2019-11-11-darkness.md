subtitle: Watch me drown
---

Honey, I'm slipping into darkness.
<br/>Don't help me,
<br/>I like this abyss that I'm in 
<br/>This was always supposed to be.
<br/>I'm dying and I like this.
<br/>Look at me and smile, as you do.
<br/>Let me see your face once more.
<br/>I love the way you look at me.
<br/>As I slide and fade away.<br/>
Im gonna sulk and wallow
<br/>In my own creation,
<br/>the castle of sorrow.
<br/>Feels like home, and I don't wanna leave.
<br/>Let me grab one more beer and watch me drown
<br/>As I smile and dance unconsciously.
<br/>I like the state I'm in.
<br/>Lowest rung and the most despicable crybaby.
<br/>Look at me once, and gimme that smile.
<br/>Talk to me sweet and tell me you love me
<br/>My heart will pain and I will feel it.
<br/>The love bottled up in myself.
<br/>But I won't show it
<br/>Because I'm not human.
<br/>Let me ridicule one more person
<br/>As I see them soar in love and life.
<br/>Let me see myself slip away into darkness.
<br/>As I laugh and cry and break into sadness.
