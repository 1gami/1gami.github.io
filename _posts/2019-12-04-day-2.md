This just got real. It's hard. Really hard to contain myself when my brain, which has been trained so meticulously for years tries to do it once more.
<br/> The many schemes and ruses it comes up with, is honestly astonishing.
<br/>"Oh, just open the trending page, just see what's trending on Youtube, dude"
<br/>*Oh yeah, we're gonna steal a quick glance at what's in store. And maybe we'll get lucky and watch some too!*
<br/>Shut up, brain. You're worthless. You're gonna stay a wretch for the rest of your miserable life if you do this. This is your chance to redeem yourself and unfetter yourself from this mess.
<br/>I don't just feel it in my brain, my hands automatically go for the evil buttons without even a trace of my volition. **Is this addiction?**
<br/>**Oh my god, I'm an addict.**
<br/>The worst kind of addict.
<br/>The force against me gets stronger by the day.
<br/>I think by tomorrow I'll do the deed under duress of my mind.
<br/>But the light shines for now.
<br/>Love,
<br/>Su.
