The hardest part was not masturbating, no doubt. It's muscle memory at this point, I just reach for it automatically.
<br/>And since I only had 5 hours of sleep yesterday, drowsiness was a big problem too. I had to have a coffee today.
<br/>Waking up after some deliberation and thoughts of parallel universes where none of this would've happened, I jumped into the pool and it wasn't too bad. Of course, it was chilly in the morning, but it wasn't a big deal.
<br/>I need to manage time better though. I have wasted a lot of time today, just chilling out inadvertently.
<br/>Note to self, just get up and move.
<br/>Also, kept forgetting to look at people while walking. Habits die hard.
<br/>Talking of habits, my muscle memory has espoused all these habits pretty hard. I don't even need to think. That's the spooky part. Need to train myself to be better at using my brain.
<br/>Work was okayish. It's not interesting work. It's quite bad, actually. 
<br/>But I have done it, didn't even look at porn, didn't mindlessly binge (although I ventured into a bit of graphic design indulgently, and that counts. Need to avoid these niggles). I'm a LEVEL 1 WORKER now.
<br/>Can't wait to level up to be a LEVEL 7 BOSS soon.

Love,
<br/>Su.
